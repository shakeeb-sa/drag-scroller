# React Drag Scroller 🖱️📜

**React Drag Scroller** is a high-performance Chrome extension built with **React 19** and **Vite** that introduces an intuitive "drag-to-scroll" mechanic to any website. By holding the right-click button, users can scroll through long pages or nested containers with smooth, physics-based momentum.

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **Right-Click Drag Navigation**: Seamlessly scroll vertically by holding the right mouse button and moving the cursor.
    
-   **Intelligent Target Detection**: Automatically identifies the correct scrollable container (like a sidebar or a chat window) under your cursor rather than just scrolling the main page.
    
-   **Physics-Based Movement**: Features a dynamic scroll loop with acceleration and "dead zones" for precise control.
    
-   **Visual Feedback**: A dynamic anchor UI appears at the starting point, changing color and scaling its arrow size based on your scroll speed.
    
-   **On-the-Fly Speed Control**: Adjust scroll sensitivity in real-time using the **W/S** keys or **Arrow Up/Down** while scrolling.
    
-   **Smart Filtering**: Automatically ignores inputs, textareas, links, and editable content to prevent interference with typing or clicking.
    
-   **Domain Blacklisting**: Includes a settings menu to disable the extension on specific websites.
    

## ⌨️ Shortcuts & Controls

-   **Hold Right-Click**: Activate drag scrolling.
    
-   **Ctrl + Shift + Q**: Open the Settings Menu / Master Toggle.
    
-   **W / Arrow Up**: Increase scroll sensitivity.
    
-   **S / Arrow Down**: Decrease scroll sensitivity.
    

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

-   **Framework**: React 19 (Functional Components & Hooks).
    
-   **Build Tool**: Vite (Configured for Chrome Extension content scripts).
    
-   **Performance**: Utilizes `requestAnimationFrame` for the physics loop and direct DOM manipulation for UI scaling to ensure 60FPS performance.
    
-   **State Management**: Combination of `useState` for UI and `useRef` for high-frequency physics data to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
